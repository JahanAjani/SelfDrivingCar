    "Before we start using tensorflow, keras or anyother library, it is best to learn how this library works conceptually. So, to do that we will write our own library - MiniFlow which will work similiarly like tensorFlow. Why this is important? Well, before using this abstractions Isn't it is good to learn how under the hood this library works? forward pass, backprop, derivatives or chain rule?\n",
